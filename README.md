# myseleniumtest

### Java Selenium template project that will allow you to start writing your UI automation right away.
I recently had to write Java Selenium tests for the first time in a decade.  I was surprised how Selenium documentation is still not so user-friendly, and it took me a lot of time just to set up the project.

So I created a one-stop shop Java Selenium project that people can just clone and set up everything and start writing the tests.  

To run the tests please run the following:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/c-higashi/myseleniumtest.git
cd myseleniumtest
./gradlew --rerun-tasks clean test
```
